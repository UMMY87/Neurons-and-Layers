# Neurons-and-Layers in Linear and Logistic Regression
## Linear and Logistic Regression with TensorFlow and NumPy
### Introduction
This repository contains code snippets demonstrating the implementation of linear and logistic regression models using TensorFlow and NumPy. Both models are trained on simple datasets and their results are visualized using matplotlib.

### Linear Regression
The linear regression model is created using TensorFlow's Keras API with a single dense layer. A dense layer, also known as a fully connected layer, consists of neurons, each connected to every neuron in the previous layer. In this model, the input layer consists of one neuron representing the size of the house, and the output layer consists of one neuron representing the predicted price. The model is trained to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted and actual prices. After training, the model's predictions are visualized by plotting the data points along with the linear regression line.

### Logistic Regression
The logistic regression model is constructed using TensorFlow's Keras API with a single dense layer. Similar to linear regression, the dense layer in logistic regression consists of neurons, with each neuron connected to every neuron in the previous layer. However, in logistic regression, the output of the dense layer is passed through a sigmoid activation function, which squashes the output to a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of belonging to one class. The model is trained to classify data points into two classes based on a single feature. The model's decision boundary is visualized using matplotlib by plotting the data points along with the logistic regression curve.
